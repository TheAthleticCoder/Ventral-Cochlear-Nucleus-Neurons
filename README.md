## **Objectives**

We understand the existing work done in this field and come to the conclusion that The many
discrepancies between the previous models and the new experimental data suggests that there
is a need to examine the roles $K^+$ currents play in regulating the electrical activity of VCN
neurons. More than anything in order to code it out, it became important to understand the VCN
Somatic model, its biology and all the currents that describe it. After that, it became easy to
code out the model and generate results.
